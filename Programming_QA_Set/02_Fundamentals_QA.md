# ❓ Q&A — Computer Fundamentals & Basics

---

## Q1. What is a Computer?
**Answer:** A computer is an **electronic device** that accepts input, processes it, stores data, and produces output.
It follows the **IPO cycle** — Input → Process → Output.

## Q2. What is the difference between Hardware and Software?

**Answer:**
| Hardware | Software |
|---------|---------|
| Physical parts you can touch | Programs and instructions you cannot touch |
| Example: Keyboard, CPU, RAM | Example: Windows, Chrome, MS Word |
| Manufactured in factories | Written by programmers |

---

## Q3. What does CPU stand for and what does it do?
**Answer:** CPU = **Central Processing Unit**
It is the **brain of the computer**. It performs all calculations and executes instructions.
Key parts: **ALU** (Arithmetic Logic Unit), **CU** (Control Unit), **Registers**.

## Q4. What is the difference between RAM and ROM?

**Answer:**
| RAM | ROM |
|-----|-----|
| Random Access Memory | Read Only Memory |
| **Volatile** (data lost when power off) | **Non-volatile** (data permanent) |
| Used for running programs | Used for BIOS/boot instructions |
| Can be read and written | Can only be read |
| Example: 8GB DDR4 RAM | Example: BIOS chip on motherboard |

## Q5. Convert the decimal number 10 to binary.
**Answer:**
```
10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0
 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1
 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0
 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1

Read remainders bottom to top: 1010
```
**Decimal 10 = Binary 1010**

## Q6. What is the difference between a Compiler and an Interpreter?

**Answer:**
| Compiler | Interpreter |
|---------|-------------|
| Translates **entire** program at once | Translates **line by line** |
| Faster execution | Slower execution |
| Shows all errors at once | Stops at first error |
| Examples: C, C++, Java | Examples: Python, JavaScript, PHP |

---

## Q7. What is an Operating System (OS)? Name 3 examples.
**Answer:** An OS is **system software** that manages hardware resources and provides services for programs.
It acts as a **middleman between user and hardware**.
Examples: **Windows, Linux, macOS**

---

## Q8. What is the difference between System Software and Application Software?

**Answer:**
| System Software | Application Software |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Manages hardware | Performs user tasks |
| Runs in background | Runs as needed by user |
| Example: Windows, Linux, Drivers | Example: MS Word, Photoshop, Chrome |

---

## Q9. What is a bit and a byte?
**Answer:**
- **Bit** = smallest unit of data = **0 or 1**
- **Byte** = **8 bits**
- 1 KB = 1024 Bytes
- 1 MB = 1024 KB
- 1 GB = 1024 MB
- 1 TB = 1024 GB

---

## Q10. What is secondary storage? Give 3 examples.
**Answer:** Secondary storage is **non-volatile** (data stays even when power is off), used for long-term storage.
Examples: **Hard Disk Drive (HDD), Solid State Drive (SSD), USB Pen Drive**

---

## Q11. Name 3 input devices and 3 output devices.
**Answer:**
- **Input:** Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner, Microphone, Webcam
- **Output:** Monitor, Printer, Speaker, Projector

---

## Q12. What is an Algorithm?
**Answer:** An algorithm is a **step-by-step set of instructions** to solve a problem.
It must be:
- **Finite** (must end)
- **Definite** (clear and unambiguous)
- **Input/Output** (takes input, gives output)
- **Effective** (practically doable)

---

## Q13. What is the difference between source code and machine code?
**Answer:**
- **Source Code:** Code written by programmer in a high-level language (e.g., Python, C)
- **Machine Code:** Code in binary (0s and 1s) that the CPU can directly execute
- A **compiler/interpreter** converts source code → machine code

---

## Q14. What is a flowchart?
**Answer:** A flowchart is a **diagram** that visually represents the steps of an algorithm.
Key symbols:
- **Oval** = Start/End
- **Rectangle** = Process
- **Diamond** = Decision (Yes/No)
- **Parallelogram** = Input/Output
- **Arrow** = Flow direction

---

## Q15. What is binary, octal, and hexadecimal?

**Answer:**
| System | Base | Digits Used | Example |
|--------|------|------------|---------|
| Binary | 2 | 0, 1 | 1010 = 10 |
| Octal | 8 | 0–7 | 12 = 10 |
| Decimal | 10 | 0–9 | 10 = 10 |
| Hexadecimal | 16 | 0–9, A–F | A = 10 |
